description of haskell package/module:

A Haskell \emph{package} can contain a Haskell \emph{library}.  A Haskell
library consists of one or more Haskell \emph{modules}.  Each module contains
functions and values that can be used by modules from other packages.

Sometimes module use is 0, but that can be because of use of packages with just compiler extensions.
