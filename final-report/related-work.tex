We would like to have a quantitative way of measuring software quality based on
available dependencies.  This relates to the general area of software quality
metrics.

Much work has been done in the area of measuring how ``good'' a piece of
software is, but it is also a topic in which there is much disagreement on both
the applicativity and practicality of doing so\cite{metrics2004}.

We have found little existing literature related to measuring the stability,
design, and other attributes, based solely on the dependencies of a package, so
we havne opted to show the user of our visualization whatever raw data we have
been able to extract, and then let the user decide what is important to them,
instead of running complex formulas like some of the existing software quality
metrics.

Since our target group is largely open source developers working with multiple
dependencies in an ever-changing development environment, we focus on attributes
that aid in rapid development, such as the popularity of a package.  This
approach has been shown to work with e.g. the Linux
kernel.\cite{cathedral-bazaar}
